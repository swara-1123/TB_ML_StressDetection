At the first sign of anxiety or depression, traumatized people will spiral into toxic shame. Depending on the wounding messages they received from their abusers, they will not only feel the effects of anxiety and depression, but also a deep shame for being “defective” or “not good enough.” Many survivors were emotionally and/or physically abandoned, and have a deep rooted knowledge of the fact that they were insufficiently loved.

anxiety,7pqmub,"[0, 5]","so i finally got tired of being anxious and depressed, crying daily, not leaving the house a few months ago and decided it was time to see a doctor again. I would only leave to work, and couldnt hold a job very long due to the anxiety(eventually stop going after successfully alienating myself from everyone) and went to see a psychiatrist. He started me on 40mg of fluoxetine and 50mg atenolol a day with 1mg lorazepam 3x daily as needed. I averaged about 2 of the lorazepam a day, some days 3 some days 1 or even 0, and 1 time i took 4(christmas with the family, not all at once but over the course of the evening) I went back after about 2 and a half months and he increased my atenolol to 100mg and switched me to .5mg alprazolam 1x a day(from the past i knew this wouldnt be an effective dose but he wouldnt listen) For the 2 and a half months i felt like i was leading a normal life, doing well in school, seeing friends again, working, going on dates(have a girlfriend who understands my anxiety and we met when  i was drinking to deal with it so this is the worst shes ever seen me and wants me to find a new doctor) interacting with my family and not hiding in my room all day.

My uncle/ adoptive father started dating a woman that I would come to know as my mum (I always knew they weren’t biological) They had a very destructive relationship and my adoptive father was incredibly abusive towards her (like attempted stabbing & trying to set her on fire in front of me) he was never abusive towards me in fact he treated me like I was untouchable which fostered resentment between me and my “mum” They eventually spilt when I was 18 (9 years ago) and I’ve not spoken to my dad since,my mum works in a hospital and just informed me that he was admitted to the ward she works on and potentially has lung cancer. My mum is practically gleeful about it being cosmic karma for him being a horrible person but I’m uncomfortable with how happy she is that he’s ill, I’ve not really spoken to her about it because she’s the one that suffered not me so I can’t really tell her how to deal but it just seems a bit much to me to be happy.",899,1,0.6,1526500977,3,7.407909118,252,24.5,37.54,76.81,5.03,84,14.68,92.06,61.51,21.43,17.86,11.9,0,0,4.76,1.19,3.57,5.56,13.49,9.13,8.33,7.14,3.17,15.87,2.78,1.98,1.59,1.59,1.59,3.57,0.79,2.78,0.79,1.59,0.4,17.06,5.56,0,5.95,4.76,12.3,2.38,1.59,0.4,1.59,1.59,5.16,1.19,0,0.79,0.4,2.38,0.4,1.59,0,0,3.97,1.19,1.59,0.79,0.4,0,8.73,6.75,0.79,11.11,0.4,4.76,5.95,1.98,0,0.4,0,0.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.71,1.19,1.98,0,0,0,0,0,0.79,2.78,3.17,0.79,3,2.75,3,1,1,1,1.73472,1.59349,1.87673,1,1,8.581544402,-0.040515152
